## DEBUG for ZUPLUS

Run the ".py" scripts from a terminal in the following order:

1. python3 binding_error_v1.py
2. python3 binding_error_v2.py
3. python3 binding_error_v3.py
4. python3 binding_error_v4.py

These scripts build the design up from the bare minimum binding to the full gps_notebook.ipynb notebook. On ZU104 and Ultra96 boards,
the following error will eventually occur:

`ERROR: Unable to find xlnk`
