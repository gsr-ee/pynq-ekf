    "# PYNQ Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository provides an example of PYNQ supporting multiple boards from a single pip-installable package. From the same HLS/SDSoC source code, and using the same Python API and notebooks, we can develop applications which simply move across Xilinx boards. This has the potential to simplify the deployment of code in embedded applications, improve reusability and reduce design time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.  Quick Start:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal on your PYNQ board and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo pip3.6 install git+https://github.com/sfox14/pynq-ekf.git \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the \"pynq-ekf\" package to your board, and will create the \"ekf\" directory in the PYNQ_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOKS path. Here, you will find notebooks which test our EKF design.\n",

    "## 2. Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman Filter (KF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are recursive state estimators for linear and non-linear systems with additive white noise. Kalman Filters are popular because they're optimal estimators and their computation involves only matrix arithmetic which is efficient to implement on most modern processors. On the otherhand, Extended Kalman Filters deal with non-linear problems by linearising the function about the current estimate's mean and covariance. This is an approximation, but it allows Kalman Filter methods to be applied to many more real-world engineering applications (eg. GPS). The computation for the EKF is given below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt tag](./extras/imgs/rsz_ekf_5b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed introduction to Kalman Filtering is given [here](./BACKGROUND.md) including some slides and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Design and Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount and type of computation for both KF and EKF can vary a lot between applications. For this reason, we have a choice of two architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hardware-Software (HW-SW): This design offers flexibility and generality because only the application-independent part of the algorithm is accelerated on the FPGA. The application specific code can be written in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hardware-Only (HW): This design can offer higher performance by deploying the entire algorithm on the FPGA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of both architectures are determined by two parameters: 1.) the number of states (N), and 2.) the number of observations (M). This repository contains bitstreams and libraries for both architectures, and includes an automatic build flow for rebuilding different (N,M) configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardware-Software (HW-SW):\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows how the computation is separated between PS and PL. The variables used here are explained in the [background](./BACKGROUND.md) and are consistent with our Python and HLS code. This design offers runtime flexibility and can be generalised for KF and EKF problems. The state (x) as well as the state (P), process (Q) and observation (R) covariance matrices can be loaded at runtime. Furthermore, the state transition function (f(x)) and observation model (h(x)) are computed in software. This allows compatability with more complex systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PL implements the required matrix operations in a dataflow architecture. The figure below gives an illustration of the type and sequence of computation that is performed. The primary computational bottleneck is the matrix inversion. We implemented this via LU Decomposition and this [app note](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp1317-scalable-matrix-inverse-hls.pdf). This design requires a relatively large amount of data from external memory each iteration. On small problems, this approach gives bad performance since the majority of time is spent transferring data between processor and FPGA. Furthermore, converting between Fixed and Floating point number representations is expensive and further reduces system throughput/performance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./extras/imgs/dataflow.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hardware (HW):\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the performance drawbacks of the HW-SW co-design, it may be better to implement the entire algorithm on the FPGA. The [gps_example.ipynb](./notebooks/gps_example.ipynb) notebook gives an example for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Build Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our build flow is documented [here](./build/BUILD.md). It allows us to target multiple boards against the same HLS/SDSoC source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "make PLATFORM=<eg. /home/usr/platform/Pynq-Z1> BOARD=<eg. Pynq-Z1, Ultra96> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Known Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HW-SW HLS/SDSoC designs using ACP cache coherent ports are not working.\n",
    "\n",
